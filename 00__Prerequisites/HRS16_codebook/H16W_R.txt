         The health of our Veterans is an important national concern. There is great
         interest in how Veterans get their health care, how they use or don't use the
         Veterans Affairs health care system and how the care they receive affects
         Veterans' health. We are working together with the Department of Veterans
         Affairs to study these important issues, and you can make an important
         contribution to those efforts.
         
         We are asking our participants who have served in the active military of the
         United States to complete a form authorizing us to obtain information on the
         health care services that they may have obtained in the VA health care system.
         This information, when combined with the other information you have provided to
         us, will be a unique and valuable resource for answering key questions about the
         health of the country's military Veterans. Even if you don't normally use VA
         services it will be helpful to this research to have your authorization.
         
         We want to assure you that the Health and Retirement Study is committed to
         taking the utmost care to protect the confidentiality of any information you
         give us, including the information on your VA health care.
