         I'll read a set of 10 words and ask you to recall as many as you can. We have
         purposely made the list long so that it will be difficult for anyone to recall
         all the words -- most people recall just a few. Please listen carefully as I
         read the set of words because I cannot repeat them. When I finish, I will ask
         you to recall aloud as many of the words as you can, in any order. Is this
         clear?

         In this task, on each screen you will be presented with several numbers that
         make up a series. 	There will be one or more empty boxes somewhere in the
         series. Sometimes the empty boxes will be at the end of the series, 	and
         sometimes they will be in the middle. Please look at the pattern of numbers and
         enter the number that goes in each empty box.
         
         For example:
         Please enter the number that belongs in the empty box.
         
         The answer we were looking for is 3, so the completed sequence is:
         1 2 3 4

         Let's try another one. I'm going to read you a series of numbers. There will be
         a blank number in the series that I read to you. I would like you to write down
         the numbers from left to right and then tell me what number goes in the blank
         based on the pattern of numbers.
         	
         2 . . . 4 . . . 6 . . . BLANK
         	
         (Now please look at the number you just wrote down and tell me the number that
         goes in the blank.)
         	
         CORRECT RESPONSE: 8
         
         INSTR: If the respondent says he or she does not know the answer, record CTRL-D.
         Do not record a  "Don't Know" response as "R doesn't understand instructions."

         The sequence is 2 4 6 8.
         
         8 is the answer we were looking for because, in this example, the numbers
         increase by 2.

         I am now going to ask you six more questions like the one you just did. 
         Sometimes the blank will be at the end of the series, and sometimes it may be at
         the beginning or in the middle. You may be asked a question with more than one
         blank in the sequence. The numbers might increase, like 2, 4, 6, or decrease,
         like 6, 4, 2. Some of the problems may be easy but others may be hard. Just do
         the best you can. It is more important to answer the item correctly than to
         answer quickly, so take a little time to think before answering. It is okay if
         you do not know the answer because some of the items are intended to be very
         difficult. You can go on to the next item at any time. Are you ready to begin?
         	
         INSTR: Make sure R has pencil and paper ready for writing down the numbers.
         Repeat instructions for the R if necessary.
         	
         INSTR: Permit as much time as R wishes for each question. If the R has not given
         an answer after about a minute, ask:
         
         Would you just like to go on to the next question?
         	
         INSTR: Press 1 to continue.

         Now we want you to remember what [First Name] was like two years ago and to
         compare it with what [he/she] is like now. Two years ago was in [Year 2 years
         ago].
         
         I will read situations where [First Name] has to use [his/her] memory or
         intelligence and we would like you to indicate whether this has improved, stayed
         the same, or gotten worse in that situation over the past two years.
         
         Note the importance of comparing [his/her] present performance with two years
         ago. So if two years ago [First Name] always forgot where [he/she] had left
         things, and  [he/she] still does, then this would be considered 'not much
         change'.
