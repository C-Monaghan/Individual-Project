         Thank you for sharing with us this invaluable information about how your life
         has changed during the Coronavirus pandemic. We understand that each person's
         experience may be different. For that reason, later in the interview we'll
         invite you to tell us in your own words about the most important changes for you
         and your family because of the pandemic. Until then, we'll proceed with the HRS
         questionnaire as usual.

         User Note:  Interviewer-administered item.
