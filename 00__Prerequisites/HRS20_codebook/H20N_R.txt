         The next questions are about health insurance, both public and private. Medicare
         is a public health insurance program for people 65 or older and for disabled
         persons. Medicaid, which may be called something different in your state, is a
         public health insurance program for people with low incomes.
         
         Are you currently covered by Medicare health insurance?

         ALL: We would like to understand how people's medical history affects their
         financial status, and how use of health care may change as people age.  To do
         that, we need to obtain information about health care costs and diagnoses.

         DO NOT HAVE MEDICAID CONSENT FROM A PREVIOUS WAVE (Z277_PWHAVEMEDICAID NOT 1:
         The best place to get this information without taking up a lot more of your time
         is in the records from the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services.  Would you
         allow us to link to these data using your name and other information?

         older, certain younger people with disabilities, and people with End-Stage Renal
