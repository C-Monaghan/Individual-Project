         Think of this ladder as representing where people stand in our society. At the
         top of the ladder are the people who are the best off - those who have the most
         money, most education, and best jobs. At the bottom are the people who are the
         worst off - who have the least money, least education, and the worst jobs or no
         jobs. The higher up you are on this ladder, the closer you are to the people at
         the very top and the lower you are, the closer you are to the people at the very
         bottom.
                 
         Please mark an X on the rung on the ladder where you would place yourself.  Mark
